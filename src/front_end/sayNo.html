            <div>
              <ul>
                <li>Be Direct and Clear</li>
                <p>Example: “No, I won’t be able to help with that today.”</p>
                <li>Use the “Sandwich” Method</li>
                <p>Start with kindness, say no, end with kindness.
                  <br>
                  “I really appreciate you thinking of me, but I have to say no this time. Hope it all goes well!”
                </p>
                <li>Set Boundaries Early</li>
                <p>Let people know what you’re comfortable with so it’s easier to say no when needed.</p>
                <li>Offer an Alternative (If You Want)</li>
                <p>“I can’t join today, but maybe next week?”</p>
                <li>Don’t Over-Explain</li>
                <p>You don’t owe anyone a long reason. A simple, respectful no is enough.</p>

            <h3>A True Story</h3>
            <p>
              Sara was always the “yes” girl. One day, her classmate asked her to do a project for him. She didn’t want to, but she didn’t want to seem mean.
              <br>
              Instead of saying no, she said yes—and stayed up all night finishing it. 😩
              <br>
              The next time, she used what she learned:
              <br>
              “Sorry, I can’t do your part, but I can help you get started.”
              <br>
              Her friend respected her more—not less. And she felt proud of standing up for herself. 💪
